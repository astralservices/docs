### Getting to the Dashboard

First, you need to sign in to Astral with your Discord account.

![Authenticate with Discord](auth-page.png)

If you're on Safari, our authentication service may not work correctly. To fix this, disable Website Tracking in Safari settings.

Please note that we never track you, this is a limitation of our current authentication system and how it works, and rest assured that we are working on a fix.

After you have signed in, click "Continue to Dashboard"
