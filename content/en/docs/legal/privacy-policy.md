## How we protect your information

Your data is hosted by Supabase and physically stored in the United States (AWS us-east-1).

We have enabled Supabase's RLS (Row Level Security) to ensure that your data is only accessible to the people who need it.

We also route all database requests through our API to ensure that your data is secure.

## Who processes your data

Your data is processed by the following parties:

- Stripe [and their subprocessors](https://stripe.com/service-providers/legal): They handle credit card information and processing.
- Discord and their subprocessors: They handle account information for signing up and logging in to Astral.
- Roblox and their subprocessors: They handle connections to Roblox to provide our services.
- Supabase and their subprocessors: They handle all database requests, and house all data.
- Hetzner Online GmbH and their subprocessors: They handle anything related to our servers that our services require.

## Who has access to this data?

Governments or law enforcement may request data from Stripe, Discord, Roblox, Supabase, or Hetzner at any time, which we have no control over. Supabase can theoretically access database data at any time, but data stored in our databases have proper security measures (see [How long is data stored and how is it protected?](#how-long-is-data-stored-and-how-is-it-protected)). Government or law enforcement requests to any of our subprocessors are out of our control, with those entities having their own policies of when to forfeit data over.

We only forfeit information we collect to governments or law enforcement when required to do so by a legal order such as a court order or subpoena.

Because you must use Discord to create an account, you are also under [their privacy policy.](https://discord.com/privacy) Because you must verify your Roblox account, you are also under [their privacy policy.](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/articles/115004630823) Payments are processed through Stripe, which means that in the event that you pay for our services, you are also under [their privacy policy.](https://stripe.com/privacy) We recommend that you review their privacy policies to undersertand their data polices, as well.

## What if there's a data breach?

In the event of a data breach, we will notify users within 72 hours of us becoming aware of the breach via our web app, email, and our Discord server.

## How long is data stored and how is it protected?

Data you give to us via Discord and Roblox is stored until you delete your data. Transactions through Stripe are kept up to 3 years after you delete your data to comply with financial regulations in the United States. Analytical data collected with Umami are stored indefinetely.

All data is encrypted using modern, standardised, and secure methods. Emails sent to and from our servers use DKIM, SPF, and secure mail servers to protect both our prviacy and yours, as well as better validate email authenticity. Our sites use HSTS, only use HTTPS, and have strict CSP policies to prevent malicious scripts from being run. We sign DPAs and other privacy agreements to ensure data is handled strictly for the purpose of providing our services with other companies we work with to protect your data. We undergo occasional third-party audits to ensure your data is protected from numerous individuals, organisations, and/or government authorites.

We take appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, hashing and salting to protect the data we store, as well as only use secure methods to configure our servers to prevent data breaches. We do our best to create an environment as secure as possible to protect your data. However, no system is perfect, and we cannot be held responsible if data goes missing because of a misconfiguration, poor setup, or conditions out of our control, such as hijaking via physical access. We encrypt our data with keys that we possess.

## Data handling for minors

We do not knowingly collect data on users under the age of 13, or other minimum age required by a user's country. In the event that we are made aware of someone under this age requirement registers for our service, we take appropriate means to delete that data permanently.

## Where can I find past versions of this policy?

We keep past versions of our policy [here.](https://github.com/astralservices/docs/blob/master/content/en/docs/legal/privacy-policy.md) When changes are made to this policy, we will notify all users via our web app and email.

## Your GDPR and CCPA rights

We believe that you have the right to access, correct, and delete your data.

You can easily request all the data we have on you in your [user settings](https://dash.astralapp.io/settings).
