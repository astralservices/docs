## Introduction

At Astral, we believe that remaining trustworthy and respectful is a core value of our community. Our values and opinions may differ from those of other communities, but we believe that we can be trusted to provide the best possible service to all of our users. We have created these rules to help keep our community, and company, safe and respectful.

## Overview

- Do not use any of our services for illegal purposes.
- Do not attempt to start drama or drama-inducing conversations between users or staff members.

- We do not tolerate violent right-wing or nationalist propaganda, or any form of right-wing symbolism, or promoting any right-wing ideologies.
- We do not tolerate the spread of misinformation.
- We do not tolerate racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, misogony, or any other forms of hate speech.

### Technical

- Do not attempt to copy or steal any assets or designs from Astral in an attempt to pass them off as your own work.
  - You may be inspired from our work or designs, but we ask that you ask us first.
  - If we notice any form of stealing or copying of our designs and/or assets without asking, we will take appropriate actions against the offender.

## Social

- Do not attempt to start drama within our various communities.
  - These various communities include our Discord server, social medias, and any other methods of communication that we utilize.
- Respect others, especially staff members.
  - Going back to one of our core values, we believe that being respectful is the best thing for a person. We ask you to follow this value.
- We do not tolerate any kind of threatening behavior such as doxxing, name-calling, and intentional misgendering or deadnaming.
  - This falls under harassment, and will never be tolerated in our communities.
- We do not tolerate violent right-wing or nationalist propaganda, or any form of right-wing symbolism, or promoting any right-wing ideologies.
  - These ideologies can include Nazism, "Q-Anon", Facism, White nationalism, Antisemitism, and more.

  - This includes vaccine misinformation, claims of election fraud, or any other forms of misinformation.
- We do not tolerate racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, misogony, or any other forms of hate speech.
  - This one is self-explanitory. We don't stand for it.
- Do not disparage, tarnish, or otherwise harm, in our opinion, Astral Services and/or the website.
